                      SRv6 Security Considerations
                draft-bdmgct-spring-srv6-security-latest

Abstract

   SRv6 is a traffic engineering, encapsulation, and steering mechanism
   utilizing IPv6 addresses to identify segments in a pre-defined
   policy.  While SRv6 uses what appear to be typical IPv6 addresses,
   the address space is treated differently, and in most (all?) cases.

   A typical IPv6 unicast address is comprised of a network prefix, host
   identifier, and a subnet mask.  A typical SRv6 segment identifier
   (SID) is broken into a locator, a function identifier, and
   optionally, function arguments.  The locator must be routable, which
   enables both SRv6 capable and incapable devices to participate in
   forwarding, either as normal IPv6 unicast or SRv6.  The capability to
   operate in environments that may have gaps in SRv6 support allows the
   bridging of islands of SRv6 devices with standard IPv6 unicast
   routing.

   As standard IPv6 addressing, there are security considerations that
   should be well understood that may not be obvious.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) [RFC8402] utilizing an IPv6 data plane is a
   source routing model that leverages an IPv6 underlay and an IPv6
   extension header called the Segment Routing Header (SRH) to signal
   and control the forwarding and path of packets by imposing an ordered
   list of path details that are processed at each hop along the
   signaled path.  Because SRv6 is fundamentally bound to the IPv6
   protocol, and because of the reliance of a new header there are
   security considerations which must be noted or addressed in order to
   operate an SRv6 network in a reliable and secure manner.

   *  SRv6 makes use of the SRH which is a new type of Routing Extension
      Header.  Therefore, the security properties of the Routing
      Extension Header are addressed by the SRH.  See [RFC5095] and
      [RFC8754] for details.

   *  SRv6 consists of using the SRH on the IPv6 dataplane which
      security properties can be understood based on previous work
      [RFC4301], [RFC4302], [RFC4303] and [RFC4942].

   This document describes various threats to SRv6 networks and also
   presents existing approaches to avoid or mitigate the threats.

3.  Threat Model

   This section introduces the threat model that is used in this
   document.  The model is based on terminology from the Internet threat
   model [RFC3552], as well as some concepts from [RFC9055] and
   [RFC7384].

3.1.  Security Components

   The main components of information security are confidentiality,
   integrity and availablity, often referred to by the acronym CIA.  A
   short description of each of these components is presented below in
   the context of SRv6 security.

3.1.1.  Confidentiality

   The purpose of confidentiality is to protect the user data from being
   exposed to unauthorized users, i.e., preventing attackers from
   eavesdropping to user data.  The confidentiality of user data is
   outside the scope of this document.  However, confidentiality aspects
   of SRv6-related information are within the scope; collecting
   information about SR endpoint addresses, SR policies, and network
   topologies, is a specific form of reconnaissance, which is further
   discussed in TBD.

3.1.2.  Integrity

   Preventing information from being modified is a key property of
   information security.  Other aspects of integrity include
   authentication, which is the ability to verify the source of
   information, and authorization, which enforces different permission
   policies to different users or sources.  In the context of SRv6,
   compromising the integrity may result in packets being routed in
   different paths than they were intended to be routed through, which
   may have various implications, as further discussed in TBD.

3.1.3.  Availability

   Protecting the availability of a system means keeping the system
   running continuously without disruptions.  The availability aspects
   of SRv6 include the ability of attackers to leverage SRv6 as a means
   for compromising the performance of a network or for causing Denial
   of Service (DoS).

3.2.  Threat Abstractions

   A security attack is implemented by performing a set of one or more
   basic operations.  These basic operations (abstractions) are as
   follows:

   *  Passive listening: an attacker who reads packets off the network
      can collect information about SR endpoint addresses, SR policies
      and the network topology.  This information can then be used to
      deploy other types of attacks.

   *  Packet replaying: in a replay attack the attacker records one or
      more packets and transmits them at a later point in time.

   *  Packet insertion: an attacker generates and injects a packet to
      the network.  The generated packet may be maliciously crafted to
      include false information, including for example false addresses
      and SRv6-related information.

   *  Packet deletion: by intercepting and removing packets from the
      network, an attacker prevents these packets from reaching their
      destination.  Selective removal of packets may, in some cases,
      cause more severe damage than random packet loss.

   *  Packet modification: the attacker modifies packets during transit.

3.3.  Threat Taxonomy

   The threat terminology used in this document is based on [RFC3552].
   Threats are classified according to two main criteria: internal vs.
   external attackers, and on-path vs. off-path attackers, as discussed
   in [RFC9055].

   Internal vs. External:  An internal attacker in the context of SRv6
      is an attacker who is located within an SR domain.  Specifically,
      an internal attacker either has access to a node in the SR domain,
      or is located on an internal path between two nodes in the SR
      domain.  In this context, the latter means that the attacker can
      be reached from a node in the SR domain without traversing an SR
      egress node, and can reach a node in the SR domain without
      traversing an SR ingress node.  External attackers, on the other
      hand, are not within the SR domain.

   On-path vs. Off-path:  On-path attackers are located in a position
      that allows interception, modification or dropping of in-flight
      packets, as well as insertion (generation) of packets.  Off-path
      attackers can only attack by insertion of packets.

   The following figure depicts the attacker types according to the
   taxonomy above.  As illustrated in the figure, on-path attackers are
   located along the path of the traffic that is under attack, and
   therefore can listen, insert, delete, modify or replay packets in
   transit.  Off-path attackers can insert packets, and in some cases
   can passively listen to some of the traffic, such as multicast
   transmissions.

                      Figure 1: Threat Model Taxonomy

   It should be noted that in some threat models the distinction between
   internal and external attackers depends on whether an attacker has
   access to a trusted or secured (encrypted or authenticated) domain.
   The current model defines the SR domain as the boundary that
   distinguishes internal from external threats, and does not make an
   assumption about whether the SR domain is secured or not.  However,
   it can be assumed that the SR domain defines a trusted domain with
   respect to SRv6, and thus that external attackers are outside of this
   trusted domain.

   [RFC9256] [RFC8986]

4.1.  Encapsulation of packets

4.1.1.  Allowing potential circumvention of existing network ingress /
        egress policy.

   SRv6 packets rely on the routing header in order to steer traffic
   that adheres to a defined SRv6 traffic policy.  This mechanism
   supports not only use of the IPv6 routing header for packet steering,
   it also allows for encapsulation of both IPv4 and IPv6 packets.

4.1.2.  Default allow failure mode

   Use of GUA addressing in data plane programming could result in an
   fail open scenario when appropriate border filtering is not
   implemented or supported.

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The attacks can be lunched by constructing segment lists to define
   any traffic forwarding path.  For example: Attackers change the tail
   SID in Segment List to forward traffic to unexpected destinations;
   Attackers delete the SID in Segment List to prevent packets from
   being processed, such as bypassing the billing service and security
   detection; Attackers add the SID in Segment List to get various
   unauthorized services, such as traffic acceleration; Broadband DoS/
   DDoS attacks:The attacks can be launched by constructing segment
   lists，such as inserting duplicate SRv6 address into segment lists,to
   make packets be forwarded repeatedly between two or more routers or
   hosts on specific links.[RFC5095].Typically, the Segment List length
   of SRH is limited, but when SRv6 head compression technology is used,
   the number of package compression SIDs in SRH increases, and the
   amplification effect of traffic is more obvious.

4.3.  Source Routing

   [RFC7855] In SRv6 network, each network element along the message
   forwarding path has the opportunity to tamper with the SRv6 segment
   list.

4.3.1.  Source Routing at source host

   Unlike SR-MPLS, SRv6 has a significantly more approachable host
   implementation.  Compared with SR-MPLS, SRv6 is easier to implement
   on the host side, and the threats are as follows: 1) The attacker
   generates SRv6 message by obtaining and stealing the identity and
   real SRH of real users to use unauthorized services. 2) In the
   process of transmitting SRv6 message from the user host to the
   operator network, SRH has also been tampered with, including
   interception/modification/falsification/abuse.

4.3.2.  Source Routing from PCC at network ingress

   Typically, the network operator joins the source routing at the
   header node of the SRv6 domain, and the source routing may also be
   tampered with by SRH in the SRv6 management domain.

4.3.3.  Source routing across network management domains

   SRv6 is now typically deployed in only one network management domain
   and may be deployed in different network domains in the future.  In
   particular, the network elements and threats that have really
   tampered with the list may be in different network management domains
   in Operational SRv6 Enabled Networks, causing threats that are
   difficult to trace.  As shown in the figure, suppose that when the
   network element 1 of SRv6 management domain 1 has tampered with the
   segment list, but the threat takes effect at SRv6 management domain
   2.  At this time, the threat generation and effective place are in
   different network management domains, and the management domain 2
   cannot be traced back to the location where the tampering occurred.

   thought - could be problematic in a host to host scenario involving a
   WAN and/or a data center fabric.

4.6.  Limits in filtering capabilities

4.7.  Exposure of internal Traffic Engineering paths

   Existing implementations may contain limited filtering capabilities
   necessary for proper isolation of the SRH from outside of an SRv6
   domain.

4.8.  Implications on Security Devices

   SRv6 is commonly used as a tunneling technology in operator
   networks.To provide VPN service in an SRv6 network, the ingress PE
   encapsulates the payload with an outer IPv6 header with the SRH
   carrying the SR Policy segment List along with the VPN service
   SID.The user traffic towards SRv6 provider backbone will be
   encapsulated in SRv6 tunnel.  When constructing an SRv6 packet, the
   destination address field of the SRv6 packet changes constantly and
   the source address field of the SRv6 packet is usually assigned using
   loopback address (depending on configuration),which will affect the
   security equipments of the current network.

4.8.1.  Hidden Destination Address

   When an SRv6 packet is forwarded in the SRv6 domain, its destination
   address changes constantly, the real destination address is hidden.
   Security devices on SRv6 network may not learn the real destination
   address and fail to take access control on some SRv6 traffic.

4.8.2.  Improper Traffic Filtering

   The security devices on SRv6 networks need to take care of SRv6
   packets.  However, the SRv6 packets usually use loopback address of
   the PE device a as source address.  As a result, the address
   information of SR packets may be asymmetric, resulting in improper
   filter traffic problems, which affects the effectiveness of security
   devices.  For example, along the forwarding path in SRv6 network, the
   SR-aware firewall will check the association relationships of the
   bidirectional VPN traffic packets.  And it is able to retrieve the
   final destination of SRv6 packet from the last entry in the SRH.
   When the <source, destination> tuple of the packet from PE1 to PE2 is
   <PE1-IP-ADDR, PE2-VPN-SID>, and the other direction is <PE2-IP-ADDR,
   PE1-VPN-SID>, the source address and destination address of the
   forward and backward VPN traffic are regarded as different flow.
   Eventually, the legal traffic may be blocked by the firewall.
