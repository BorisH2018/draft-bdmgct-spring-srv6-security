                draft-bdmgct-spring-srv6-security-latest

Abstract

   SRv6 is a traffic engineering, encapsulation, and steering mechanism
   itilizing IPv6 addresses to identify segments in a pre-defined
   policy.  While SRv6 uses what appear to be typical IPv6 addresses,
   the address space is treated differently, and in most (all?) cases.

   A typical IPv6 unicast address is comprised of a network prefix, host
   identifier, and a subnet mask.  A typical SRv6 segment identifier
   (SID) is broken into a locator, a function identifier, and
   optionally, function arguments.  The locator must be routable, which
   enables both SRv6 capable and incapable devices to participate in
   forwarding, either as normal IPv6 unicast or SRv6.  The capability to
   operate in environments that may have gaps in SRv6 support allows the
   bridging of islands of SRv6 devices with standard IPv6 unicast
   routing.

   As standard IPv6 addressing, there are security considerations that
   should be well understood that may not be obvious.

Internet-Draft        SRv6 Security Considerations          October 2023


3.1.  Security Components

   The main components of information security are confidentiality,
   integrity and availablitlity, often referred to by the acronym CIA.
   A short description of each of these components is presented below in
   the context of SRv6 security.

3.1.1.  Confidentiality

   The purpose of confidentiality is to protect the user data from being
   exposed to unauthorized users, i.e., preventing attackers from
   eavesdropping to user data.  The confidentiality of user data is
   outside the scope of this document.  However, confidentiality aspects
   of SRv6-related information are within the scope; collecting
   information about SR endpoint addresses, SR policies, and network
   topologies, is a specific form of reconnaissance, which is further
   discussed in TBD.

3.1.2.  Integrity

   Preventing information from being modified is a key property of
   information security.  Other aspects of integrity include
   authentication, which is the ability to verify the source of
   information, and authorization, which enforces different permission
   policies to different users or sources.  In the context of SRv6,
   compromising the integrity may result in packets being routed in
   different paths than they were intended to be routed through, which
   may have various implications, as further discussed in TBD.

3.1.3.  Availability

   Protecting the availability of a system means keeping the system
   running continuously without disruptions.  The availability aspects
   of SRv6 include the ability of attackers to leverage SRv6 as a means
   for compromising the performance of a network or for causing Denial
   of Service (DoS).

3.2.  Threat Abstractions

   A security attack is implemented by performing a set of one or more
   basic operations.  These basic operations (abstractions) are as
   follows:

   *  Passive listening: an attacker who reads packets off the network
      can collect information about SR endpoint addresses, SR policies
      and the network topology.  This information can then be used to
      deploy other types of attacks.

Internet-Draft        SRv6 Security Considerations          October 2023


   *  Packet replaying: in a replay attack the attacker records one or
      more packets and transmits them at a later point in time.

   *  Packet insertion: an attacker generates and injects a packet to
      the network.  The generated packet may be maliciously crafted to
      include false information, including for example false addresses
      and SRv6-related information.

   *  Packet deletion: by intercepting and removing packets from the
      network, an attacker prevents these packets from reaching their
      destination.  Selective removal of packets may, in some cases,
      cause more severe damage than random packet loss.

   *  Packet modification: the attacker modifies packets during transit.

3.3.  Threat Taxonomy

   The threat terminology used in this document is based on [RFC3552].
   Threats are classified according to two main criteria: internal vs.
   external attackers, and on-path vs. off-path attackers, as discussed
   in [RFC9055].

   Internal vs. External:  An internal attacker in the context of SRv6
      is an attacker who is located within an SR domain.  Specifically,
      an internal attacker either has access to a node in the SR domain,
      or is located on an internal path between two nodes in the SR
      domain.  In this context, the latter means that the attacker can
      be reached from a node in the SR domain without traversing an SR
      egress node, and can reach a node in the SR domain without
      traversing an SR ingress node.  External attackers, on the other
      hand, are not within the SR domain.

   On-path vs. Off-path:  On-path attackers are located in a position
      that allows interception, modification or dropping of in-flight
      packets, as well as insertion (generation) of packets.  Off-path
      attackers can only attack by insertion of packets.

   The following figure depicts the attacker types according to the
   taxonomy above.  As illustrated in the figure, on-path attackers are
   located along the path of the traffic that is under attack, and
   therefore can listen, insert, delete, modify or replay packets in
   transit.  Off-path attackers can insert packets, and in some cases
   can passively listen to some of the traffic, such as multicast
   transmissions.

                      Figure 1: Threat Model Taxonomy

   It should be noted that in some threat models the distinction between
   internal and external attackers depends on whether an attacker has
   access to a trusted or secured (encrypted or authenticated) domain.
   The current model defines the SR domain as the boundary that
   distinguishes internal from external threats, and does not make an
   assumption about whether the SR domain is secured or not.  However,
   it can be assumed that the SR domain defines a trusted domain with
   respect to SRv6, and thus that external attackers are outside of this
   trusted domain.

4.  Security Considerations in Operational SRv6 Enabled Networks

   [RFC9256] [RFC8986]

4.1.  Encapsulation of packets

4.1.1.  Allowing potential circumvention of existing network ingress /
        egress policy.

   SRv6 packets rely on the routing header in order to steer traffic
   that adheres to a defined SRv6 traffic policy.  This mechanism
   supports not only use of the IPv6 routing header for packet steering,
   it also allows for encapsulation of both IPv4 and IPv6 packets.

4.1.2.  Default allow failure mode

   Use of GUA addressing in data plane programming could result in an
   fail open scenario when appropriate border filtering is not
   implemented or supported.

   [RFC8754]

4.3.  Source Routing

   [RFC7855]

4.3.1.  Source Routing at source host

   Unlike SR-MPLS, SRv6 has a significantly more approachable host
   implementation.

   Existing implementations may contain limited filtering capabilities
   necessary for proper isolation of the SRH from outside of an SRv6
   domain.
